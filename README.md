The Objective of this project was not to create a beautiful GUI but rather to use Jade and its capabilities to 
develop a multi-agent system using FIPA Communication Protocols and ACL messages.

Note: This repo is duplicated from [LuisPRamos/aiad-conquest](https://github.com/LuisPRamos/aiad-conquest) due to permissions sake.

## Project planning
Before starting, we developed a plan of what classes and protocols we would implement. You can check it out [here](https://motapinto.github.io/multi-agent-system-conquest/).
